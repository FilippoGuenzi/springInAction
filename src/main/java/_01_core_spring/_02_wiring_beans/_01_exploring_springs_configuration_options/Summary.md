There are 3 ways to configure and wire beans together :
- explicit configuration in XML
- explicit configuration in Java
- implicit bean discovery and automatic wiring with Java
- implicit bean discovery and automatic wiring with XML

We can use all of them or just one : we can mix the configurations styles for different part of our project.
Automatic configuration is recommended.
